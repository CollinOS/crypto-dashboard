## Where my head is at (update at end of each session?)

Next steps are:
- add functionality for not adding a coin more than once
- Have a card appear on click of each coin to add trades for that coin and store in trades table
- Break up portfolio page into seperate components?
- neeed favorites on coins page to load the same way they do on portfolio page

For the slow loading of favorites?
